# Car-Arena-Rumble
Car Arena Rumble Is a game in unity we made as a group. where you play as a car that has to hit other cars off the edge to win. Here I worked on all of the gameplay, that means programming the car movement, physics, items/power ups. I also worked on the map, game design, keeping scores and the game loop.

Note: This game is made in 4.5 months where we worked 10 hours a week for it. So fully polishing or prepping for the game was impossible for the scope of this game.
